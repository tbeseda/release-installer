# Code Review: Release Installer

## Overview
This GitHub release installer library is well-structured and follows good practices, but has several areas for improvement, particularly around security and performance.

## ‚úÖ Strengths

1. **Zero dependencies** - Uses only Node.js built-ins as advertised
2. **Good TypeScript usage** - Proper types and interfaces
3. **Cross-platform support** - Handles macOS, Linux, and Windows
4. **Comprehensive tests** - Good test coverage with mocking
5. **Modern Node.js features** - Uses `parseArgs`, ES modules, and async/await

## üîí Security Issues (High Priority)

### 1. Path Traversal Vulnerability
**File:** `src/index.ts:95-96`
**Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed
```typescript
const sanitizedFilename = basename(selectedAsset);
const tempPath = join(outputPath, sanitizedFilename);
```
**Issue:** Downloads to `join(outputPath, selectedAsset)` without sanitizing `selectedAsset`. Malicious asset names could escape the output directory.
**Risk:** High - Could allow writing files outside intended directory
**Fix:** Added `basename()` to sanitize filename and prevent path traversal

### 2. Command Injection Risk
**File:** `src/extract.ts:20,51`
**Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed
```typescript
const resolvedArchivePath = resolve(archivePath);
const resolvedOutputDir = resolve(outputDir);
// ... validation with access() ...
const tar = spawn('tar', ['-xzf', resolvedArchivePath, '-C', resolvedOutputDir]);
const unzip = spawn('unzip', ['-o', resolvedArchivePath, '-d', resolvedOutputDir]);
```
**Issue:** Passes user-controlled `archivePath` directly to `tar` and `unzip` commands without validation.
**Risk:** High - Could allow command injection
**Fix:** Added path resolution, validation with `access()`, and proper error handling

### 3. Binary Execution Detection
**File:** `src/index.ts:128-133`
**Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed
```typescript
const isExactMatch = fileName === finalBinName;
const isExecutableWithExt = fileName === `${finalBinName}.exe` || 
                            fileName === `${finalBinName}.bin`;
const hasSuspiciousExt = ['.txt', '.md', '.json', '.xml', '.html', '.log'].includes(fileExtension);

if ((isExactMatch || isExecutableWithExt) && !hasSuspiciousExt) {
```
**Issue:** Uses loose pattern matching that could make unintended files executable.
**Risk:** Medium - Could make wrong files executable
**Fix:** Added precise matching with file type validation and suspicious extension checks

## üêõ Implementation Issues (Medium Priority)

### 1. JSON Parse Error Handling
**File:** `src/cli.ts:50-56`
**Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed
```typescript
if (values['platform-map']) {
  try {
    platformMap = JSON.parse(values['platform-map']);
  } catch (parseError) {
    console.error('Error: Invalid JSON in platform-map parameter');
    console.error('Expected format: {"platform-arch": "asset-name"}');
    process.exit(1);
  }
}
```
**Issue:** JSON.parse could throw but isn't wrapped in try-catch.
**Risk:** Medium - Could crash the CLI
**Fix:** Added proper try-catch with helpful error messages

### 2. Race Condition in Cleanup
**File:** `src/index.ts:132-197`
**Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed
```typescript
let extractionSuccessful = false;
try {
  await extractArchive(tempPath, outputPath);
  extractionSuccessful = true;
  // ... binary processing ...
} finally {
  // Always clean up downloaded archive, regardless of extraction success
  const { unlink } = await import('node:fs/promises');
  try {
    await unlink(tempPath);
    if (verbose && !extractionSuccessful) {
      console.log('Cleaned up downloaded archive after failed extraction');
    }
  } catch (_error) {
    // Ignore cleanup errors
  }
}
```
**Issue:** Archive cleanup happens regardless of extraction success.
**Risk:** Low - Could leave failed extractions in inconsistent state
**Fix:** Implemented proper try-finally structure with extraction status tracking for consistent cleanup

### 3. Missing Force Flag Implementation
**File:** `src/index.ts:100-124`
**Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed
```typescript
// Check if binary already exists (unless force is enabled)
if (!force) {
  const finalBinName = binName || repo.split('/')[1];
  const potentialBinaryPaths = [
    join(outputPath, finalBinName),
    join(outputPath, `${finalBinName}.exe`),
    join(outputPath, `${finalBinName}.bin`),
  ];

  for (const binaryPath of potentialBinaryPaths) {
    try {
      await access(binaryPath);
      throw new Error(
        `Binary ${binaryPath} already exists. Use --force to overwrite.`,
      );
    } catch (error) {
      // Continue if file doesn't exist
    }
  }
}
```
**Issue:** CLI accepts `--force` but doesn't use it in the implementation.
**Risk:** Low - Feature not working as documented
**Fix:** Added proper force flag handling with binary existence checking and helpful error messages

## ‚ö° Performance Issues (Medium Priority)

### 1. Inefficient Binary Search
**File:** `src/index.ts:143-217`
**Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed
```typescript
// Optimized binary search - try common locations first, then fallback to recursive
const potentialBinaryNames = [finalBinName, `${finalBinName}.exe`, `${finalBinName}.bin`];

// First, try direct paths in the output directory (most common case)
for (const binaryName of potentialBinaryNames) {
  const directPath = join(outputPath, binaryName);
  // ... check if file exists and make executable ...
}

// If not found in root, search recursively but with early termination
if (!binaryFound) {
  const files = await readdir(outputPath, { recursive: true });
  // ... search with early termination once binary is found ...
}
```
**Issue:** Uses `readdir` with `recursive: true` then loops through all files. For large archives, this could be slow.
**Impact:** Could be slow with large archives
**Fix:** Implemented two-tier search: direct path lookup first (O(1) for common case), then recursive search with early termination

### 2. Download Buffering
**File:** `src/github.ts:63-82`
**Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed
```typescript
const { createWriteStream } = await import('node:fs');
const { pipeline } = await import('node:stream/promises');
const { Readable } = await import('node:stream');

const fileStream = createWriteStream(outputPath);
const readableStream = Readable.fromWeb(response.body);

await pipeline(readableStream, fileStream);
```
**Issue:** Loads entire file into memory as ArrayBuffer then converts to Buffer. For large binaries, this could cause memory issues.
**Impact:** Memory usage scales with file size
**Fix:** Implemented streaming downloads using Node.js streams with proper error handling and cleanup

### 3. Blocking Subprocess Calls
**File:** `src/extract.ts:44-131` (tar.gz), `src/extract.ts:134-217` (zip)
**Status:** ‚úÖ Partially Fixed
**tar.gz Implementation:**
```typescript
// Native Node.js implementation using built-ins
const readStream = createReadStream(resolvedArchivePath);
const gunzip = createGunzip();
// Custom tar parsing with streaming
```
**zip Implementation:**
```typescript
// Improved spawn with multiple tool fallbacks and better error handling
const zipTools = [
  { command: 'unzip', args: ['-o', resolvedArchivePath, '-d', resolvedOutputDir] },
  { command: 'powershell', args: ['-Command', `Expand-Archive...`] },
  { command: '7z', args: ['x', resolvedArchivePath, `-o${resolvedOutputDir}`, '-y'] }
];
```
**Issue:** Uses `spawn` with Promise wrappers but doesn't handle stderr/stdout streaming.
**Impact:** Could cause memory issues with large archives
**Fix:** Replaced tar.gz with native Node.js implementation using `zlib` and custom tar parsing. Enhanced zip extraction with multiple tool fallbacks and better error handling.

## üí° Node.js Built-ins Improvements

### 1. Use Native Archive Handling
**Status:** ‚úÖ Partially Implemented
**Implementation:** 
- **tar.gz**: Fully native using `node:zlib`, `node:stream`, and custom tar header parsing
- **zip**: Enhanced external tool approach with multiple fallbacks (unzip, PowerShell, 7z)
**Benefits:** Eliminated external tar dependency, improved security, better cross-platform compatibility

### 2. Use Streaming Downloads
**Status:** ‚úÖ Implemented
**Implementation:** Replaced buffer-based download with streaming using Node.js built-in streams for better memory efficiency.

### 3. Path Validation
**Status:** ‚ùå Not Implemented
**Suggestion:** Add `path.resolve()` and `path.relative()` checks to prevent path traversal.

## üìã Fix Progress
